# Telegram Bot Admin Panel

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application built with React, Express.js, and Drizzle ORM that provides an admin panel for managing a Telegram bot system. The application includes user management, a coin/reward system, raffles, a virtual shop, and referral tracking. It uses PostgreSQL as the database and integrates with the Telegram Bot API.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with bcrypt for password hashing
- **API**: RESTful API with structured error handling

### Key Components

1. **Admin Panel**: Web-based interface for managing the bot system
2. **Telegram Bot**: Node.js bot using node-telegram-bot-api
3. **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL schema
4. **Authentication System**: JWT-based admin authentication
5. **Real-time Features**: Query invalidation for live updates

## Data Flow

1. **Admin Authentication**: JWT tokens stored in localStorage, validated on each request
2. **Bot Operations**: Telegram bot handles user interactions and updates database
3. **Admin Actions**: Admin panel makes API calls to modify bot settings and data
4. **Database Updates**: All changes go through Drizzle ORM to PostgreSQL
5. **Real-time Updates**: TanStack Query automatically refreshes data

## External Dependencies

### Core Technologies
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with drizzle-kit for migrations
- **Bot API**: node-telegram-bot-api for Telegram integration
- **Authentication**: bcrypt for password hashing, jsonwebtoken for tokens

### UI Components
- **Component Library**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons

### Development Tools
- **Build**: Vite with TypeScript support
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution
- **Production**: esbuild for server bundling

## Deployment Strategy

The application is designed for deployment on cloud platforms with the following structure:

1. **Frontend**: Static files served from `dist/public`
2. **Backend**: Node.js server running on configurable port
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL connection via environment variable
4. **Environment Variables**: 
   - `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
   - `BOT_TOKEN`: Telegram bot token
   - `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT signing
   - `PORT`: Server port (defaults to 5000)

### Database Schema

The application uses a comprehensive PostgreSQL schema with the following main tables:

- **users**: Telegram user data with coins and referral tracking
- **admins**: Admin accounts for panel access
- **transactions**: All coin-related transactions with metadata
- **raffles**: Raffle management with entries and winners
- **raffleEntries**: User entries in raffles
- **shopItems**: Virtual shop items with pricing
- **purchases**: Shop purchase history
- **botSettings**: Configurable bot parameters

### Security Considerations

1. **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing for admin passwords
2. **Authentication**: JWT tokens with expiration
3. **API Security**: Bearer token authentication on protected routes
4. **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for data validation
5. **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored in environment variables

The application follows modern web development practices with TypeScript throughout, proper error handling, and a clean separation of concerns between frontend and backend components.
