# Resolving the Merge Conflict in server/index.ts

## Current Situation
You're in the middle of a rebase with merge conflicts in `server/index.ts`. The conflict is minor - it's just about code formatting and indentation.

## Steps to Resolve

### 1. First, abort the current rebase in the Shell:
```bash
git rebase --abort
```

### 2. Check the current status:
```bash
git status
```

### 3. If you see the update-github.sh file missing, create it again:
```bash
chmod +x update-github.sh
```

### 4. Now, let's try a different approach - merge instead of rebase:
```bash
git config pull.rebase false
git pull origin main
```

### 5. If you get merge conflicts again, open `server/index.ts` and:
- Look for lines starting with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`
- These mark the conflict areas
- The content between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` is your local version
- The content between `=======` and `>>>>>>> [commit hash]` is from GitHub

### 6. To resolve, keep your local version (which is working):
- Delete all lines with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`
- Keep only the code that looks correct (without extra indentation)
- Make sure there are no duplicate sections

### 7. After fixing the file, mark it as resolved:
```bash
git add server/index.ts
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict - keeping local working version"
```

### 8. Finally, push to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```

## Alternative: Force Push (Use with Caution!)
If the above doesn't work and you're SURE your local version is correct:
```bash
git push origin main --force
```

This will overwrite the GitHub version with your local version.

## Need Help?
If you're stuck, you can:
1. Check what's different between local and remote:
   ```bash
   git diff origin/main
   ```

2. Or reset to match GitHub exactly (losing local changes):
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git reset --hard origin/main
   ```
